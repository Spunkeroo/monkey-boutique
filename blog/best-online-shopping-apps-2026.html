<h1>Best Online Shopping Apps That Save Money 2026</h1>

<p style="color:#999;font-size:14px">Published February 27, 2026 &bull; 14 min read &bull; by <a href="https://monkey.boutique/">Monkey Boutique</a></p>

<p>There are hundreds of shopping apps claiming to save you money, but most of them are not worth the storage space on your phone. After testing every major shopping app available in 2026, I have identified the ones that deliver real, measurable savings without requiring you to change your shopping habits.</p>

<p>The apps on this list fall into four categories: cashback apps that give you a percentage back on purchases, coupon finders that automatically apply discount codes, price trackers that tell you when to buy, and deal aggregators that surface the best promotions. Using the right combination of these apps can realistically save you $500 to $1,500 per year depending on how much you shop online.</p>

<h2 id="cashback">Best Cashback Apps</h2>

<h3>1. Rakuten (Best Overall Cashback)</h3>

<p>Rakuten is the gold standard for cashback shopping. The platform partners with over 3,500 online retailers and offers cashback rates ranging from 1 percent to 15 percent depending on the store and current promotions. During major shopping events like Black Friday and back-to-school season, rates can temporarily spike to 20 percent or more.</p>

<p>How it works: you activate cashback through the Rakuten app or browser extension before shopping, make your purchase as normal, and the cashback accrues in your account. Rakuten pays out quarterly via PayPal or check. The average active user earns over $100 per year in cashback, and heavy online shoppers can earn significantly more.</p>

<p>What makes Rakuten stand out is the breadth of its retailer network. Major stores like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Nike, Sephora, Macy's, and thousands more are included. The browser extension makes it effortless because it automatically notifies you when cashback is available on the site you are visiting.</p>

<h3>2. Ibotta (Best for Everyday Purchases)</h3>

<p>Ibotta has evolved from a grocery receipt scanning app into a comprehensive cashback platform covering over 300 retailers for both in-store and online purchases. What differentiates Ibotta is its strength in everyday categories like groceries, household essentials, health and beauty products, and convenience store purchases.</p>

<p>The app works two ways: for online purchases, you activate cashback offers before shopping similar to Rakuten. For in-store purchases, you link a loyalty card or scan your receipt after shopping. Ibotta has a lower minimum payout threshold of $20 compared to Rakuten's quarterly schedule, and pays via PayPal, Venmo, or gift cards.</p>

<h3>3. TopCashback (Highest Cashback Rates)</h3>

<p>TopCashback consistently offers the highest cashback rates in the industry. Where Rakuten might offer 3 percent at a particular retailer, TopCashback frequently offers 5-7 percent at the same store. The trade-off is a smaller retailer network, roughly 4,000 stores compared to Rakuten's wider selection, and a less polished user experience.</p>

<p>For large purchases like electronics, appliances, and travel bookings, the higher cashback rates at TopCashback can translate to significant savings. If you are buying a $1,500 laptop and TopCashback offers 5 percent versus Rakuten's 2 percent, that is a $45 difference on a single purchase.</p>

<h2 id="coupon">Best Coupon Finder Apps</h2>

<h3>1. Capital One Shopping (Best Auto-Apply)</h3>

<p>Capital One Shopping, formerly known as Wikibuy, is the most effective automatic coupon finder available. When you reach the checkout page of an online store, the browser extension scans its database of coupon codes, tests them automatically, and applies the one that gives you the biggest discount. No searching for codes, no copying and pasting, no expired code frustration.</p>

<p>Beyond coupons, Capital One Shopping also compares prices across other retailers and alerts you if the same product is available cheaper elsewhere. It tracks price drops on items in your cart and notifies you when prices fall. You do not need a Capital One credit card to use it. The app is completely free and works with any payment method.</p>

<h3>2. Honey by PayPal (Most Popular Coupon App)</h3>

<p>Honey is the most widely used coupon extension with over 17 million users. Like Capital One Shopping, it automatically finds and applies coupon codes at checkout. Honey also features Droplist, a price tracking tool that monitors products and alerts you when prices drop.</p>

<p>Honey Gold is the app's rewards program. You earn Honey Gold points on qualifying purchases that can be redeemed for gift cards at popular retailers. This effectively adds a small cashback component on top of the coupon savings. Between coupon savings and Honey Gold earnings, active users save an average of $126 per year.</p>

<h2 id="price">Best Price Tracker Apps</h2>

<h3>1. CamelCamelCamel (Best for Amazon)</h3>

<p>CamelCamelCamel is the definitive Amazon price tracker. It maintains complete price history charts for every product on Amazon, showing you exactly how prices have fluctuated over days, weeks, months, and years. Before buying anything on Amazon, checking CamelCamelCamel tells you whether the current price is genuinely a good deal or if it was cheaper last month.</p>

<p>You can set price alerts for any Amazon product. When the price drops to your target, CamelCamelCamel sends you an email notification. The browser extension, called The Camelizer, embeds price history charts directly into Amazon product pages so you can see the data without leaving the site.</p>

<h3>2. Google Shopping (Best Multi-Retailer Price Comparison)</h3>

<p>Google Shopping is the most comprehensive price comparison tool because it indexes prices from virtually every online retailer. Search for any product and Google Shopping shows you every retailer that sells it, their current prices, shipping costs, and seller ratings. The price tracking feature lets you monitor products and receive notifications when prices drop.</p>

<h2 id="deals">Best Deal Aggregator Apps</h2>

<h3>1. Slickdeals (Best Community-Driven Deals)</h3>

<p>Slickdeals is the largest deal-sharing community on the internet. Users post deals they find across the web, and the community votes on them, pushing the best deals to the front page. The app sends push notifications for deals that match your interests, and the Slickdeals browser extension automatically shows you if a better deal exists for the product you are viewing.</p>

<p>The community-driven model means Slickdeals surfaces deals that algorithms miss. Pricing errors, unadvertised sales, stackable coupons, and clearance finds regularly appear on the site hours before they are picked up by other deal sites.</p>

<h3>2. ShopSavvy (Best Barcode Scanner)</h3>

<p>ShopSavvy is the best app for comparing prices while shopping in physical stores. Scan any product barcode and ShopSavvy instantly shows you the price at competing online and local retailers. If the same product is $15 cheaper on Amazon or at the Target across town, ShopSavvy tells you immediately. This prevents impulse purchases at inflated prices and gives you leverage for price matching.</p>

<h2 id="grocery">Best Grocery Savings Apps</h2>

<h3>1. Ibotta (Best Overall Grocery Savings)</h3>

<p>Ibotta dominates grocery savings with cashback offers at major chains including Walmart, Kroger, Target, Costco, Sam's Club, and Albertsons. The app offers both brand-specific cashback offers (save $1 on a specific cereal brand) and any-brand offers (save $0.25 on any bread). Heavy grocery shoppers can save $30-$60 per month using Ibotta consistently.</p>

<h3>2. Fetch Rewards (Easiest to Use)</h3>

<p>Fetch Rewards is the simplest grocery savings app. Scan any grocery receipt and earn points on thousands of popular brands. There are no offers to activate, no barcodes to scan individually, and no loyalty cards to link. Just snap a photo of your receipt and the app automatically identifies qualifying products and awards points. Points are redeemable for gift cards at hundreds of retailers.</p>

<h2 id="stacking">How to Stack Apps for Maximum Savings</h2>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>The Savings Stack</h3>
<p>The most effective savings strategy is stacking multiple apps on the same purchase. Here is the optimal stack for online shopping: use CamelCamelCamel or Google Shopping to time your purchase when the price is lowest. Use Capital One Shopping or Honey to automatically apply the best coupon code. Use Rakuten or TopCashback to earn cashback on top of the sale price and coupon. This triple stack can save 20-40 percent on many purchases compared to buying at full price without any apps.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Step 1: Set price alerts.</strong> For non-urgent purchases, add items to your CamelCamelCamel watchlist or Honey Droplist. Wait for a price drop notification before buying. Patience alone can save 15-30 percent on many products.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Activate cashback.</strong> Before clicking "buy," open Rakuten or TopCashback and activate the cashback offer for the store you are shopping at. This takes two seconds and earns you 1-15 percent back.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Let coupon finders work at checkout.</strong> Capital One Shopping and Honey automatically test coupon codes when you reach the checkout page. Let them run and apply whatever saves you the most.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Scan the receipt.</strong> If you bought groceries or household items, scan the receipt with Ibotta and Fetch Rewards. Both can credit the same receipt, effectively doubling your savings on qualifying items.</p>

<h2 id="avoid">Apps to Avoid</h2>

<p><strong>Apps that require excessive personal data.</strong> If an app asks for your Social Security number, bank login credentials, or access to all your accounts just to find coupons, it is not worth the privacy trade-off. Legitimate savings apps need minimal personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Apps with unrealistic earning claims.</strong> Any app promising you will "earn $500/month just for shopping" is exaggerating. Realistic savings from shopping apps are $50-$150 per month for active online shoppers. Claims far beyond this should raise skepticism.</p>

<p><strong>Apps with extremely high minimum payouts.</strong> Some cashback apps require you to accumulate $50 or more before you can cash out. This delays your savings and increases the chance you will forget about the app before reaching the threshold. Prefer apps with $5-$20 minimum payouts.</p>
