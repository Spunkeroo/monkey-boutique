    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which platform has the lowest transaction fees?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "WooCommerce and BigCommerce charge zero platform transaction fees. You only pay the payment processor fee, typically 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction with Stripe or PayPal. Shopify charges an additional 0.5-2% transaction fee on top of payment processing if you do not use Shopify Payments. Squarespace charges 0% transaction fees on Business and Commerce plans but 3% on the Personal plan."}}

<h1>Best Shopify Alternatives for Boutique Owners 2026</h1>

<p style="color:#999;font-size:14px">Published February 27, 2026 &bull; 14 min read &bull; by <a href="https://monkey.boutique/">Monkey Boutique</a></p>

<p>Shopify is the most popular ecommerce platform in the world, but it is not the best choice for every boutique owner. At $39 per month for the Basic plan (increased from $29 in 2023), plus transaction fees if you do not use Shopify Payments, plus paid apps for features that should be standard, the costs add up quickly. Many boutique owners find themselves paying $100 to $200 per month when all the necessary apps are included.</p>

<p>The good news is that in 2026, there are excellent alternatives that offer comparable or better features for boutique-specific needs at lower price points. Some are even free. This guide compares the best Shopify alternatives specifically for boutique owners, evaluating each on pricing, design quality, ease of use, transaction fees, and features that matter most to fashion and lifestyle retailers.</p>

<h2 id="woocommerce">1. WooCommerce (Best Free Option)</h2>

<p>WooCommerce is a free, open-source ecommerce plugin for WordPress. It powers over 6.5 million online stores worldwide, making it the most-used ecommerce platform by install count. For boutique owners who want maximum control over their store with the lowest possible monthly cost, WooCommerce is the strongest option.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing breakdown:</strong> The WooCommerce plugin is free. Hosting costs $3 to $30 per month depending on the provider. A domain name costs $10 to $15 per year. Premium WordPress themes optimized for boutiques cost $40 to $80 one-time. SSL certificates are included free with most hosts. Total first-year cost: as low as $50 to $100 compared to Shopify's minimum of $468 per year.</p>

<p><strong>Why boutique owners love WooCommerce:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zero transaction fees from WooCommerce itself. You only pay your payment processor (typically 2.9% + $0.30 with Stripe or PayPal)</li>
<li>Thousands of free and premium themes designed specifically for fashion and boutique stores</li>
<li>Complete control over design, functionality, and customer experience</li>
<li>50,000+ plugins for any feature you can imagine: wishlists, size charts, lookbooks, loyalty programs, and more</li>
<li>No monthly platform fee that increases as you grow</li>
<li>Full ownership of your store data and code</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The honest downside:</strong> WooCommerce requires more technical involvement than Shopify. You are responsible for hosting, security updates, plugin compatibility, and performance optimization. If something breaks, you need to fix it yourself or hire someone. For boutique owners who are not comfortable with basic WordPress management, the learning curve can be frustrating.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended hosting for WooCommerce boutiques:</strong> SiteGround ($3.99/month for startup), Bluehost ($2.95/month with WooCommerce pre-installed), or Cloudways ($14/month for better performance). For boutiques expecting significant traffic, Cloudways or a managed WordPress host like Kinsta ($35/month) provides faster page loads that directly impact conversion rates.</p>

<h2 id="squarespace">2. Squarespace (Best for Design)</h2>

<p>Squarespace is the platform for boutique owners who want their online store to look as beautiful as their products. The templates are designed by professional designers and are consistently more visually polished than templates on any other platform. For fashion boutiques, lifestyle brands, and design-conscious retailers, Squarespace creates stores that feel premium.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Business plan with ecommerce starts at $33 per month (billed annually) with a 3% transaction fee. Commerce Basic at $36 per month removes the transaction fee and adds features like customer accounts, abandoned cart recovery, and product reviews. Commerce Advanced at $65 per month adds subscriptions, advanced shipping, and commerce APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Why boutiques choose Squarespace:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most beautiful templates of any ecommerce platform, period</li>
<li>Built-in Instagram shopping integration that syncs your product catalog</li>
<li>Professional blog built-in for content marketing (critical for boutique SEO)</li>
<li>Email marketing tools included at no extra cost</li>
<li>No app store bloat because most features are built into the platform</li>
<li>Excellent mobile-responsive design on all templates</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Fewer ecommerce-specific features than Shopify or BigCommerce. Limited payment gateway options (Stripe, PayPal, Square, Afterpay). No multi-currency support on lower plans. The product variant system is less flexible than Shopify for boutiques with complex size and color options. App ecosystem is much smaller than Shopify or WooCommerce.</p>

<h2 id="bigcommerce">3. BigCommerce (Best for Growth)</h2>

<p>BigCommerce is the platform for boutiques that plan to scale. It includes more built-in features than any other platform at every price point, which means fewer paid add-ons. Features that Shopify charges extra for through apps, such as product filtering, abandoned cart emails, customer groups, and multi-channel selling, are included in BigCommerce's standard plans.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Standard plan starts at $39 per month (same as Shopify Basic). Plus plan at $105 per month adds customer segmentation, abandoned cart saver, and stored credit cards. Pro plan at $399 per month adds Google customer reviews, custom faceted search, and custom SSL.</p>

<p><strong>Key advantage for boutiques:</strong> Zero transaction fees on every plan regardless of which payment gateway you use. Shopify charges 0.5% to 2% on top of payment processing if you use any gateway other than Shopify Payments. For a boutique doing $10,000 per month in sales, that saves $50 to $200 per month compared to Shopify with a third-party gateway.</p>

<p><strong>Built-in features that Shopify charges extra for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product filtering and faceted search</li>
<li>Real-time shipping quotes from major carriers</li>
<li>Customer groups and segment-based pricing</li>
<li>Abandoned cart recovery emails</li>
<li>Multi-channel selling (Amazon, eBay, Instagram, Facebook, Google Shopping, TikTok, Pinterest)</li>
<li>Unlimited staff accounts on all plans</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wix">4. Wix eCommerce (Easiest to Use)</h2>

<p>Wix is the easiest ecommerce platform to use, and it is not close. The drag-and-drop editor lets you design your store visually by moving elements around the page exactly where you want them. There is no coding, no technical knowledge, and no steep learning curve. If you can use a presentation tool like PowerPoint or Canva, you can build a Wix store.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Business Basic at $17 per month includes online store, payments, and 50 GB storage. Business Unlimited at $25 per month adds subscriptions, automated sales tax, and advanced shipping. Business VIP at $35 per month adds priority support, loyalty programs, and advanced analytics.</p>

<p><strong>Why boutiques like Wix:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most intuitive store builder for beginners</li>
<li>800+ designer templates including dozens specifically for fashion and boutiques</li>
<li>Wix AI Site Builder can generate a complete store from a text description</li>
<li>Built-in marketing tools: email campaigns, social media posts, SEO tools</li>
<li>No transaction fees on any plan</li>
<li>Dropshipping integration with Modalyst and Spocket</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Once you choose a template, you cannot switch to a different one without rebuilding your store. SEO performance has historically been weaker than WordPress and Shopify, though Wix has made significant improvements. The app ecosystem is smaller than Shopify. Not ideal for stores with more than 500 products due to performance considerations.</p>

<h2 id="ecwid">5. Ecwid (Best for Adding to Existing Site)</h2>

<p>Ecwid takes a unique approach: instead of replacing your website, it adds a store to your existing one. If you already have a website on WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or any other platform, Ecwid embeds a fully functional online store into it. This makes it ideal for boutique owners who already have a website and blog they love and do not want to rebuild everything on a new platform.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free plan includes 5 products and basic store features. Venture plan at $19 per month offers 100 products, social selling, and marketplace integrations. Business plan at $39 per month provides unlimited products, abandoned cart recovery, and wholesale pricing. Unlimited plan at $99 per month adds everything including POS and priority support.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Boutique owners who have an established website or blog and want to add ecommerce without migrating to a new platform. Also excellent for selling on multiple channels since Ecwid syncs inventory across your website, Facebook Shop, Instagram, Amazon, and eBay from a single dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="etsy">6. Etsy (Best for Handmade and Vintage)</h2>

<p>Etsy is not a traditional ecommerce platform, but for boutiques specializing in handmade, vintage, or unique items, it provides built-in access to 90+ million active buyers who are specifically looking for products like yours. The marketplace model means you do not need to drive your own traffic from day one.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> No monthly fee for basic shops. Etsy charges a $0.20 listing fee per item (renewed every four months or when sold), a 6.5% transaction fee on the sale price including shipping, and payment processing of 3% + $0.25. Etsy Plus at $10 per month adds shop customization, restock alerts, and advertising credits.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Boutiques selling handmade clothing, vintage items, custom accessories, and one-of-a-kind pieces. The 6.5% transaction fee is high, but the built-in marketplace traffic can be worth it for sellers who do not have an established audience.</p>

<h2 id="choose">How to Choose the Right Platform</h2>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>Quick Decision Guide</h3>
<p><strong>Lowest budget possible:</strong> WooCommerce with affordable hosting or Ecwid free plan.<br>
<strong>Beautiful design is priority #1:</strong> Squarespace Commerce.<br>
<strong>Planning to scale beyond $50K/month:</strong> BigCommerce.<br>
<strong>Complete beginner, want the easiest setup:</strong> Wix eCommerce.<br>
<strong>Already have a website you love:</strong> Ecwid.<br>
<strong>Selling handmade or vintage:</strong> Etsy (plus your own site).<br>
<strong>Selling on Instagram and TikTok:</strong> Squarespace or BigCommerce.</p>
</div>

<p>One critical consideration: do not choose a platform based solely on price. The cheapest platform that does not convert visitors into buyers costs you more than a pricier platform that does. A Squarespace store with beautiful product photography and a smooth checkout experience will outsell a poorly designed WooCommerce store every time. Invest in the platform that best showcases your products and makes buying frictionless.</p>

<p>Also consider switching costs. Moving an established store from one platform to another is painful and can temporarily hurt your SEO, customer experience, and sales. Choose a platform you can grow into rather than one you will outgrow in a year.</p>
