  "mainEntity": [
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What are the best websites for designer deals in 2026?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The best websites for designer deals in 2026 include The RealReal and Vestiaire Collective for authenticated pre-owned luxury, Gilt and Rue La La for flash sales on new designer items at 40-70% off, Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th for online outlet shopping, and SSENSE and FARFETCH during their seasonal sales for current-season designer pieces at 30-50% off. For maximum savings, combine these platforms with cashback extensions like Rakuten (up to 10% back) and browser tools like Honey that automatically apply promo codes at checkout."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is buying pre-owned designer safe online?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, when you use authenticated platforms. The RealReal employs over 100 trained authenticators and gemologists who physically inspect every item. Vestiaire Collective uses a combination of AI screening and human authentication. Both platforms guarantee authenticity and offer full refunds for any item that fails verification. eBay's Authenticity Guarantee program sends luxury items through independent authenticators before delivery. Avoid buying designer items on unverified platforms like Facebook Marketplace or unvetted Instagram sellers, where counterfeit rates are significantly higher."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "When do designer brands have the biggest sales?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The biggest designer sales happen during four key periods. End-of-season sales in January and June/July offer 30-50% off at most luxury retailers and department stores. Black Friday and Cyber Monday in late November bring site-wide discounts of 20-40% at retailers like SSENSE, NET-A-PORTER, and FARFETCH. Private sale events typically happen two to four weeks before end-of-season sales and are accessible via email signup or loyalty programs. Flash sale sites like Gilt run daily sales year-round with discounts of 40-70% off retail on past-season designer items."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How can I tell if a designer deal is actually good?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A genuinely good designer deal meets three criteria. First, the original price should be verifiable on the brand's official website or authorized retailers. Second, the discount should be at least 30% off the verified retail price. Third, the item should be authentic and in good condition (or new with tags). Be skeptical of discounts that seem too dramatic, like 90% off current-season items, as these often indicate counterfeit goods or inflated original prices. Use price tracking tools like Google Shopping to compare prices across multiple retailers and verify that the sale price is actually below market rate."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is cashback stacking and how does it work for designer shopping?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cashback stacking means combining multiple savings methods on the same purchase to maximize your total discount. For example, you might buy a designer bag during a 30% off sale on FARFETCH, use a Rakuten cashback link for an additional 6% back, apply a promo code found by the Honey browser extension for another 10% off, and pay with a credit card that earns 3% back on online purchases. The result could be a total effective discount of 40-45% on an item that started at 30% off. Each layer is independent and does not conflict with the others. This approach works on almost every major luxury e-commerce platform."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are outlet designer items the same quality as mainline?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Not always. Some outlet items are genuine past-season pieces that did not sell at full price and were sent to outlets. These are identical quality to mainline products. However, many brands also manufacture made-for-outlet items that use lower-quality materials and construction. Brands like Coach, Michael Kors, and Kate Spade have extensive outlet-specific product lines. You can usually identify made-for-outlet items by checking for factory store tags, slight differences in hardware or lining, and model numbers that differ from mainline products. For true quality, prioritize last-season mainline pieces on resale platforms over made-for-outlet products."}}

<h2 id="why-pay-less">Why You Should Never Pay Full Retail for Designer</h2>

<p>The luxury fashion industry operates on enormous markups. A leather handbag that costs a brand $80 to $150 in materials and manufacturing retails for $1,500 to $3,000 or more. You are not paying for the materials. You are paying for brand positioning, marketing budgets that run into hundreds of millions of dollars, retail store leases on the world's most expensive shopping streets, and shareholder profit margins. Understanding this reality is the first step toward shopping smarter.</p>

<p>The secondary market for luxury fashion has exploded in the past five years. The global luxury resale market reached an estimated $49 billion in 2025, according to ThredUp's annual resale report, and is projected to grow to $82 billion by 2028. This growth has created a sophisticated ecosystem of authenticated platforms, consignment services, and deal-finding tools that make it easier than ever to buy genuine designer items at significant discounts.</p>

<p>Paying full retail for most designer items is simply unnecessary in 2026. Between authenticated resale platforms, flash sale sites, online outlets, seasonal sales, cashback programs, and strategic timing, a savvy shopper can consistently save 40 to 80% on luxury fashion without sacrificing quality or authenticity. This guide covers every method in detail.</p>

<h2 id="authenticated-resale">Authenticated Resale Platforms</h2>

<p>Authenticated resale is the single best way to buy designer items at a discount. These platforms guarantee that every item has been verified as genuine by trained experts, eliminating the risk of counterfeits that plagues peer-to-peer marketplaces.</p>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>The RealReal</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Savings:</strong> 40-70% off retail</p>
<p><strong>Authentication:</strong> In-house team of 100+ trained authenticators and gemologists</p>
<p><strong>Categories:</strong> Clothing, handbags, shoes, jewelry, watches, home decor</p>
<p><strong>Return Policy:</strong> 14-day returns for store credit, 3 days for refund</p>
<p>The RealReal is the largest authenticated luxury consignment platform in the world. Every item is physically inspected by their authentication team before being listed. The savings are substantial: Chanel flap bags that retail for $10,800 regularly appear for $5,000 to $7,000. Gucci loafers that retail for $890 sell for $300 to $450 in excellent condition. The platform runs frequent sitewide sales of an additional 20 to 25% off already-discounted prices, creating opportunities for savings exceeding 70% off retail.</p>
</div>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>Vestiaire Collective</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Savings:</strong> 30-60% off retail</p>
<p><strong>Authentication:</strong> AI screening plus human expert review on items over $100</p>
<p><strong>Categories:</strong> Clothing, handbags, shoes, accessories</p>
<p><strong>Return Policy:</strong> Varies by seller, most items are final sale after authentication</p>
<p>Vestiaire Collective is a global peer-to-peer luxury marketplace with over 23 million members across 80 countries. Unlike The RealReal, sellers set their own prices and ship directly to the platform for authentication before the buyer receives the item. This creates a wider range of pricing, with some sellers pricing aggressively for a quick sale. The platform is particularly strong for European designer brands and often has items that are harder to find on US-focused platforms.</p>
</div>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>eBay Authenticity Guarantee</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Savings:</strong> 30-70% off retail</p>
<p><strong>Authentication:</strong> Items shipped through independent authenticator before delivery</p>
<p><strong>Categories:</strong> Handbags, watches, sneakers, jewelry (items over $100)</p>
<p><strong>Return Policy:</strong> 30-day money-back guarantee</p>
<p>eBay's Authenticity Guarantee program routes eligible luxury purchases through independent third-party authenticators before they reach the buyer. This transforms eBay from a risky marketplace into a legitimate channel for discounted designer goods. The selection is enormous because eBay has more individual sellers than any other platform. Bidding on auction-format listings can yield even deeper discounts than buy-it-now prices. Use eBay's saved search feature with alerts to get notified when specific items are listed.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="flash-sales">Flash Sale Sites</h2>

<p>Flash sale platforms acquire designer inventory at deep discounts and pass the savings to members through time-limited sales events. These sales typically last 48 to 72 hours and feature new, unworn items from past seasons at 40 to 70% off retail.</p>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>Gilt</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Savings:</strong> 40-70% off retail</p>
<p><strong>Membership:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Sale Schedule:</strong> New sales launch daily at noon ET</p>
<p>Gilt has been the leader in flash sales since 2007. Daily sales feature curated selections from brands like Valentino, Burberry, Prada, Saint Laurent, and hundreds of other designer labels. Items are brand new and authentic. The key to success on Gilt is speed: popular items sell out within the first hour of a sale. Enable push notifications for brands you care about and be ready to check out immediately when a sale goes live. Gilt also offers a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZRVGW6G?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">curated selection of designer home goods</a> at similar discounts.</p>
</div>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>Rue La La</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Savings:</strong> 40-65% off retail</p>
<p><strong>Membership:</strong> Free (invite-based but open registration)</p>
<p><strong>Sale Schedule:</strong> New sales launch daily at 11 AM ET</p>
<p>Rue La La operates similarly to Gilt with daily flash sales on designer fashion, accessories, and home goods. The platform tends to have slightly different brand partnerships than Gilt, so checking both sites daily increases your chances of finding specific items. Rue La La's vacation and experience packages are also worth monitoring for luxury travel deals.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="online-outlets">Online Outlet Stores</h2>

<p>Most major department stores and luxury retailers operate online outlet channels that offer past-season merchandise at permanent discounts. These are not flash sales with limited availability; they maintain large inventories with consistent pricing.</p>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>Nordstrom Rack (nordstromrack.com)</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Savings:</strong> 30-65% off retail</p>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> Mix of department store overstock and outlet-specific merchandise</p>
<p>Nordstrom Rack's online platform carries thousands of designer items at significant discounts. The "Clear the Rack" events, which happen approximately every six weeks, offer an additional 25% off already-reduced clearance prices. Sign up for email notifications to catch these events. The inventory refreshes frequently, so checking weekly increases your chances of finding designer pieces at deep discounts.</p>
</div>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>Saks Off 5th (saksoff5th.com)</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Savings:</strong> 40-70% off retail</p>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> Past-season Saks Fifth Avenue merchandise plus outlet-exclusive items</p>
<p>Saks Off 5th is the outlet arm of Saks Fifth Avenue and carries a premium selection of designer brands including Gucci, Valentino, Burberry, and Balenciaga. Flash sales happen frequently with additional percentage-off discounts on top of already-reduced prices. The quality of the designer selection is generally higher than Nordstrom Rack due to the parent store's luxury focus.</p>
</div>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>SSENSE Sale Section</h3>
<p><strong>Typical Savings:</strong> 30-50% off retail</p>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> Current and recent season designer pieces</p>
<p>SSENSE is a full-price luxury retailer, but their sale section (live during mid-year and end-of-year periods) offers genuine discounts on current-season designer fashion. Unlike outlet stores that carry past-season or made-for-outlet items, SSENSE sale items are the exact same products that were sold at full price. The selection includes avant-garde and contemporary designer brands that are difficult to find on other platforms.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="seasonal-sales">Seasonal Sales Calendar</h2>

<p>Timing your purchases around the luxury fashion sales calendar can save thousands of dollars per year. Here are the key dates to mark.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Period</th><th>Timing</th><th>Typical Discount</th><th>Best For</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Winter Sale (End of Season)</td><td>Late December - February</td><td>30-50% off</td><td>Fall/Winter collections</td></tr>
<tr><td>Summer Sale (End of Season)</td><td>Late June - August</td><td>30-50% off</td><td>Spring/Summer collections</td></tr>
<tr><td>Black Friday / Cyber Monday</td><td>Late November</td><td>20-40% sitewide</td><td>Current season + gifts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Private Sales</td><td>2-4 weeks before end-of-season</td><td>25-40% off</td><td>First access before public sale</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flash Sales (Gilt, Rue La La)</td><td>Year-round, daily</td><td>40-70% off</td><td>Past-season items</td></tr>
<tr><td>Singles Day (11.11)</td><td>November 11</td><td>20-30% off</td><td>Global luxury platforms</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Sign up for email lists at NET-A-PORTER, FARFETCH, SSENSE, and Mytheresa at least one month before sale periods. Most luxury retailers send private sale access to email subscribers 2 to 4 weeks before the public sale begins. Private sale access means first pick of the best items before they sell out.
</div>

<h2 id="cashback-stacking">Cashback Stacking Strategy</h2>

<p>Cashback stacking is the single most overlooked strategy for saving on designer fashion. By layering multiple independent savings mechanisms on the same purchase, you can add 10 to 20% in additional savings on top of any sale price.</p>

<h3>Layer 1: Cashback Portal (2-10% back)</h3>
<p>Before visiting any luxury e-commerce site, start your shopping journey through a cashback portal like Rakuten, TopCashback, or BeFrugal. These portals pay you a percentage of your purchase for routing through their affiliate link. Rakuten regularly offers 6 to 10% cashback at FARFETCH, 4 to 8% at Saks Fifth Avenue, and 2 to 5% at NET-A-PORTER. These rates often increase during holiday periods and special promotions to 12 to 15%.</p>

<h3>Layer 2: Promo Code (5-15% off)</h3>
<p>Apply any available promo codes at checkout. Browser extensions like Honey and Capital One Shopping automatically test available codes. First-time buyer discounts of 10 to 15% are available at most luxury e-commerce sites. FARFETCH, SSENSE, and Mytheresa all offer welcome discounts for new email subscribers.</p>

<h3>Layer 3: Credit Card Rewards (1.5-5% back)</h3>
<p>Pay with a credit card that maximizes rewards for online shopping. The Chase Sapphire Reserve earns 3x points on general travel and dining, but cards like the Citi Double Cash (2% flat), the Wells Fargo Active Cash (2% flat), or the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards (3% in a chosen category including online shopping) provide consistent returns on every purchase. Some cards offer elevated rewards at specific retailers through their shopping portals.</p>

<h3>Layer 4: Gift Cards at a Discount (3-10% off)</h3>
<p>Buy retailer gift cards at a discount before making your purchase. Sites like Raise and CardCash sell gift cards to Nordstrom, Saks, and other retailers at 3 to 10% below face value. Buying a $500 Nordstrom gift card for $460 gives you an instant 8% discount before any other savings methods are applied.</p>

<p>When all four layers are stacked, your total savings can reach 15 to 25% on top of any sale price. On a $2,000 designer bag already marked down 30% to $1,400, cashback stacking could save you an additional $210 to $350, bringing the effective price to $1,050 to $1,190, or 40 to 47% off the original retail price.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="promo-codes">Finding Promo Codes That Actually Work</h2>

<p>Most promo code websites are filled with expired or fake codes. Here are the methods that consistently produce working codes for luxury retailers.</p>

<p><strong>Browser Extensions:</strong> Install the Honey browser extension (owned by PayPal) and Capital One Shopping. Both automatically test available codes at checkout and apply the best one. They work silently in the background and frequently find 10 to 15% off codes that you would never discover manually.</p>

<p><strong>First-Time Buyer Discounts:</strong> Almost every luxury e-commerce site offers a welcome discount for new email subscribers, typically 10 to 15% off your first order. FARFETCH offers 10% off for new app users. SSENSE offers 10% off for first-time email subscribers. Mytheresa offers 10% off your first order. Use a dedicated email address for shopping signups to keep these offers organized and easy to find.</p>

<p><strong>Student and Military Discounts:</strong> Several platforms offer permanent discounts for verified students and military personnel. UNiDAYS and Student Beans partner with brands like ASOS, Nike, and select luxury retailers for 10 to 20% off. SheerID verification is used by many brands including Coach, Kate Spade, and Michael Kors for student discounts.</p>

<p><strong>Abandon Cart Technique:</strong> Add items to your cart and leave the site without purchasing. Many luxury retailers send a follow-up email within 24 to 48 hours with a 10 to 15% off code to entice you to complete the purchase. This works consistently at FARFETCH, Mytheresa, and several other major platforms. Some retailers instead offer free expedited shipping as a cart abandonment incentive.</p>

<h2 id="price-tracking">Price Tracking and Alert Tools</h2>

<p>Luxury items fluctuate in price across platforms. Setting up price alerts ensures you buy at the lowest possible price without constant manual checking.</p>

<p><strong>Google Shopping:</strong> Search for specific designer items on Google Shopping to compare prices across dozens of retailers instantly. Save searches and enable price drop notifications for items you are watching.</p>

<p><strong>CamelCamelCamel:</strong> For designer items sold on Amazon (which carries some luxury brands through authorized third-party sellers), CamelCamelCamel tracks historical pricing and sends alerts when prices drop below your target.</p>

<p><strong>Lyst:</strong> Lyst aggregates inventory from over 12,000 brands and retailers, showing you every place where a specific designer item is available along with the price at each retailer. Their price comparison feature instantly identifies the lowest price. Set alerts for specific items to be notified of price drops and new listings.</p>

<h2 id="outlet-quality">Outlet vs Mainline Quality: What to Know</h2>

<p>Not all outlet merchandise is created equal. Understanding the difference between genuine markdowns and made-for-outlet products helps you make informed purchasing decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Genuine Markdowns:</strong> These are items that were originally sold at full price in mainline stores and did not sell during the season. They are transferred to outlet stores at a discount. The quality, materials, and construction are identical to what was sold at the full-price boutique. On The RealReal and at Saks Off 5th, many items fall into this category.</p>

<p><strong>Made-for-Outlet (MFO):</strong> Many brands manufacture separate product lines specifically for their outlet stores. These items were never intended for full-price retail. They often use lower-quality materials, simpler construction, and less refined hardware. Coach Factory, Michael Kors Outlet, and Kate Spade Outlet all have extensive MFO lines. The "compare at" price printed on the tag is often inflated to create the illusion of a larger discount than you are actually receiving.</p>

<p><strong>How to Tell the Difference:</strong> Look for style numbers that match mainline products (check the brand's website for current and past-season style numbers). Check for quality indicators like leather feel, hardware weight, lining material, and stitching consistency. Read reviews from outlets that specifically note whether items are MFO or genuine markdowns. When in doubt, buying from authenticated resale platforms guarantees you are getting mainline quality.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-fakes">How to Avoid Counterfeits</h2>

<p>The counterfeit luxury goods market is worth an estimated $600 billion globally. Protecting yourself requires vigilance and knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Buy from authenticated platforms only.</strong> The RealReal, Vestiaire Collective, eBay Authenticity Guarantee, Rebag, and Fashionphile all employ professional authenticators. These platforms stake their business reputation on authenticity and offer guarantees.</p>

<p><strong>Be skeptical of prices that are too good.</strong> A brand-new Chanel Classic Flap for $2,000 (retail $10,800) is almost certainly counterfeit. Genuine deals on highly sought-after items like Chanel, Hermes, and limited-edition pieces are typically 20 to 40% off retail, not 70 to 80% off. If a deal seems too good to be true, it is.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid unverified social media sellers.</strong> Instagram and Facebook Marketplace are flooded with counterfeit luxury goods. Sellers often use photos of authentic items to advertise fakes. Unless the seller is a verified, established business with a physical address and return policy, avoid purchasing designer items through social media.</p>

<p><strong>Learn brand-specific authentication markers.</strong> Each luxury brand has specific details that distinguish authentic items from counterfeits: serial number formats, hardware styles, stitching patterns, font details on logos, and material characteristics. For high-value purchases, consider using an independent authentication service like Entrupy (AI-powered, 99.1% accuracy) or Real Authentication (expert human review) before buying from any non-authenticated source.</p>

<h2 id="best-brands">Best Brands for Resale Value</h2>

<p>Some designer brands retain their value significantly better than others, making them smarter purchases even at full price because you can resell them later and recoup a large portion of your investment.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Brand</th><th>Resale Value Retention</th><th>Best Items for Resale</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Hermes</td><td>80-120%+ (often appreciates)</td><td>Birkin, Kelly, Constance bags</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chanel</td><td>70-95%</td><td>Classic Flap, Boy Bag, 2.55</td></tr>
<tr><td>Louis Vuitton</td><td>60-80%</td><td>Neverfull, Speedy, Alma</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rolex</td><td>80-150%+ (often appreciates)</td><td>Submariner, Daytona, GMT-Master</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bottega Veneta</td><td>50-70%</td><td>Jodie, Cassette, Pouch</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prada</td><td>40-60%</td><td>Re-Nylon, Galleria, Re-Edition</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Hermes Birkin bags are the only fashion investment that has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over 35 years, appreciating an average of 14.2% annually according to a study by Baghunter. While most designer purchases should not be treated as investments, choosing brands with strong resale value means your cost of ownership is dramatically lower because you can sell the item later for a significant portion of what you paid.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq">
<details>
<summary>What are the best websites for designer deals in 2026?</summary>
<p>The best platforms include The RealReal and Vestiaire Collective for authenticated pre-owned luxury at 40-70% off, Gilt and Rue La La for flash sales on new designer items, Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th for online outlet shopping, and SSENSE and FARFETCH during seasonal sales for current-season pieces at 30-50% off. Stack cashback from Rakuten with promo codes and credit card rewards for maximum savings.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is buying pre-owned designer safe online?</summary>
<p>Yes, when you use authenticated platforms. The RealReal employs over 100 trained authenticators who physically inspect every item. Vestiaire Collective uses AI screening plus human authentication. eBay's Authenticity Guarantee routes items through independent authenticators before delivery. All these platforms guarantee authenticity and offer refunds for items that fail verification. Avoid unverified sellers on social media where counterfeit rates are high.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>When do designer brands have the biggest sales?</summary>
<p>The four key sale periods are: end-of-season sales in January and June/July (30-50% off), Black Friday/Cyber Monday in late November (20-40% sitewide), private sale events 2-4 weeks before end-of-season (25-40% off, email subscribers only), and flash sale sites like Gilt which run daily sales year-round at 40-70% off retail. Sign up for email lists at luxury retailers at least a month before sale periods for early access.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I tell if a designer deal is actually good?</summary>
<p>Verify the original price on the brand's official website or authorized retailers. The discount should be at least 30% off the verified retail price. The item must be authentic and in stated condition. Be skeptical of discounts exceeding 70% on current-season items, as these often indicate counterfeits or inflated original prices. Use Google Shopping and Lyst to compare prices across multiple retailers and confirm the deal is genuine.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is cashback stacking and how does it work?</summary>
<p>Cashback stacking combines multiple independent savings methods on one purchase. Start with a cashback portal like Rakuten (2-10% back), add a promo code at checkout (5-15% off), pay with a rewards credit card (1.5-5% back), and optionally buy discounted gift cards beforehand (3-10% off). These layers do not conflict with each other. On a $2,000 bag already 30% off, stacking can add another 15-25% in savings, bringing total discounts to 40-50% off retail.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are outlet designer items the same quality as mainline?</summary>
<p>Not always. Some outlet items are genuine past-season pieces transferred from full-price stores at identical quality. However, many brands manufacture made-for-outlet items with lower-quality materials and construction. Brands like Coach, Michael Kors, and Kate Spade have extensive outlet-specific lines. Check for factory store tags, compare style numbers to mainline products, and assess material quality. For guaranteed mainline quality, buy from authenticated resale platforms like The RealReal instead of outlet stores.</p>
</details>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The luxury fashion industry depends on the perception that designer items are only accessible at full retail prices. The reality is that a massive and growing ecosystem of authenticated resale platforms, flash sale sites, online outlets, and deal-finding tools puts genuine designer fashion within reach at 40 to 80% less than retail. The key is knowing where to look and timing your purchases strategically.</p>

<p>Start with one approach, whether it is setting up alerts on The RealReal for specific items, installing Rakuten for cashback on your next luxury purchase, or signing up for Gilt's daily flash sales. As you become comfortable, layer multiple strategies together. The cashback stacking method alone can save hundreds of dollars per year on designer purchases you would have made anyway.</p>
